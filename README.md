# Wireless-Deauthentication-Attack
Simulated a wireless DoS attack by sending deauth frames to disconnect clients from Wi-Fi networks.  Captured and analyzed 802.11 traffic, identified WPA/WPA2 vulnerabilities, and explored mitigation techniques in a controlled lab environment. 
# Wireless Deauthentication Attack Simulation

This project simulates a **Wi-Fi deauthentication denial of service (DoS) attack** to demonstrate wireless security vulnerabilities and testing techniques in a controlled lab environment.

## üìù Project Description

In this project, we:

- **Simulated a wireless DoS attack** by sending deauthentication frames to disconnect clients from a Wi-Fi network.
- **Captured and analyzed 802.11 traffic** to understand the behavior of management frames.
- **Identified WPA/WPA2 vulnerabilities** related to unprotected management frames.
- **Explored mitigation techniques** like 802.11w Management Frame Protection in a controlled lab setup.
