# Wireless-Deauthentication-Attack
Simulated a wireless DoS attack by sending deauth frames to disconnect clients from Wi-Fi networks.  Captured and analyzed 802.11 traffic, identified WPA/WPA2 vulnerabilities, and explored mitigation techniques in a controlled lab environment. 
# Wireless Deauthentication Attack Simulation

This project simulates a **Wi-Fi deauthentication denial of service (DoS) attack** to demonstrate wireless security vulnerabilities and testing techniques in a controlled lab environment.

## 📝 Project Description

In this project, we:

- **Simulated a wireless DoS attack** by sending deauthentication frames to disconnect clients from a Wi-Fi network.
- **Captured and analyzed 802.11 traffic** to understand the behavior of management frames.
- **Identified WPA/WPA2 vulnerabilities** related to unprotected management frames.
- **Explored mitigation techniques** like 802.11w Management Frame Protection in a controlled lab setup.

## 🚀 Setup & Installation

### 1. Enable Monitor Mode

Ensure your Wi-Fi adapter supports monitor mode. Activate it:

```bash
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
Check interface (usually becomes wlan0mon).

2. Install Python Dependencies
Clone this repository and install Scapy:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/<YourUsername>/Wireless-Deauth-Attack.git
cd Wireless-Deauth-Attack
pip install -r requirements.txt
📂 Project Files
File	Description
deauth_attack.py	Python script using Scapy to send deauth frames
requirements.txt	Required Python libraries
README.md	Project overview and instructions

💻 Usage (Python Script)
Edit deauth_attack.py:

interface: Your monitor mode interface (e.g., wlan0mon)

target_client: Victim MAC address (or FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF to target all clients)

ap_mac: Access Point MAC address

Run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo python3 deauth_attack.py
🔧 Alternative CLI-Based Attack
Using aireplay-ng:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 1000 -a <AP_MAC> -c <Client_MAC> wlan0mon
Replace <AP_MAC> with the router/AP MAC address.

Replace <Client_MAC> with the client device MAC or leave blank for broadcast.

🛡️ Mitigation Techniques Explored
✅ Implementing 802.11w Management Frame Protection (MFP)
✅ Using Wireless IDS/IPS to detect rogue deauth frames
✅ Enabling client isolation and strong WPA2/WPA3 configurations

🎯 Learning Outcomes
✔️ Understanding 802.11 management frames
✔️ Simulating deauthentication DoS attacks safely
✔️ Analyzing Wi-Fi vulnerabilities using Scapy, aireplay-ng, and Wireshark
✔️ Practicing ethical hacking methodologies for wireless networks
